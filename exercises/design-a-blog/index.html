                    Meizu's new phones don't have notches

                        Chinese company Meizu has unveiled its new range of smartphones, the 15 series, and it seems to be taking a stand against current trends in phone design. You won’t find notches or even tall screens here — just large, intact rectangles. It’s actually kind of refreshing.

                        There are three phones: the 5.95-inch 1440p OLED Meizu 15 Plus, the 5.46-inch 1080p OLED Meizu 15, and the 5.46-inch 1080p LCD Meizu 15 Lite. The Plus uses a Samsung Exynos 8895 processor, unusually — which is the same chip found in international models of the Galaxy S8 — while the 15 has a Snapdragon 660 and the Lite employs a Snapdragon 626.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Design-wise, imagine an iPhone 7 Plus with thinner bezels on all four sides and you’re pretty much there. The phones even manage to fit a circular fingerprint reader-equipped home button below the screen. Meizu is also touting a linear vibration motor to work with this button and other features throughout the Flyme 7 software, something desperately lacking in most Android phones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two OLED models have a dual 20-megapixel and 12-megapixel rear camera setup, while all three have 20-megapixel selfie cameras. The Lite and the 15 have 4GB of RAM and 3,000mAh batteries, while the Plus is upgraded to 6GB and 3,500mAh. All the phones have headphone jacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the 15 series looks like a pretty solid lineup if you’ve been less than enamored with the way phone design has been going of late. The Plus will sell from 3,000 yuan (about $475) in China, the 15 will sell for 2,500 yuan (~$400), and the Lite will cost 1,700 yuan (~270).

                    Product launch: a trip to the Taco Bell Space Station

                        “I don’t want the Taco Bell International Space Station. I think it goes against what the public perceives the space station is supposed to be like.” — a quote from Erin MacDonald, an engineer for Engility’s Space and Mission Systems Group, during a panel on space sponsorship at the 34th Space Symposium, Space News reports.

                        Over my headset, I hear the flight controller counting down on the launch live stream.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “T-minus five minutes to liftoff.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don’t think my heart has ever pounded this hard. I’m strapped into a seat inside one of SpaceX’s SpriteDragon™ capsules, sitting on top of a Pepsi™ Falcon 9 rocket. And I’m just 300 seconds away from my first trip to space. With every second that ticks away, my nerves send an electric shock throughout my body. I’ve never been more exhilarated or more petrified.
